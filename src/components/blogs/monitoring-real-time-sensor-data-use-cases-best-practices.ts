                "In today’s on‑demand world, businesses expect data instantly—not in delayed reports. Real‑time sensor monitoring empowers faster decisions and proactive responses across industries. For IoT deployments, freshness of data is critical: alerts, dashboards, and automations rely on live sensor values to deliver value before the data loses relevance."
